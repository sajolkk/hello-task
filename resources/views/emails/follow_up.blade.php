Hi {{ $user['name'] }},
<br> <br>
It was great chatting with you earlier. I'm just getting in touch to check whether you had a chance to review the email I sent to you previously and whether you could reply?
<br> <br>
If I don't hear from you in the next few days, I'll give you a call.
<br> <br> <br>
Best regards,
<br>
